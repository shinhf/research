What is difference between managed and unmanaged ingress controller?

- __Managed Ingress Controller:__ The cloud provider (in this case, Azure) is responsible for deploying, managing, scaling, patching, and updating the ingress controller software and its underlying infrastructure. You, as the user, interact with it as a service, focusing on configuring ingress rules for your applications. The __Application Routing addon__ in AKS is the primary example of this, providing a fully managed NGINX ingress controller.

- __Unmanaged (or Self-Hosted) Ingress Controller:__ You are responsible for the entire lifecycle of the ingress controller. This includes selecting the ingress software (e.g., community NGINX, Traefik, Contour), deploying it to your AKS cluster (typically via Helm or YAML manifests), configuring it, scaling the controller pods, and performing all necessary security patches and version upgrades.
