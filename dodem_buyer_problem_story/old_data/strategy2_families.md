### **Slide 2: The Challenge: The Caregiver's Dilemma**

* **Headline:** You're More Than a Caregiver. You're the Family's IT Support.
* **Key Stat 1:** "Nearly 1 in 4 U.S. adults are now part of the 'Sandwich Generation,' squeezed between caring for an aging parent and their own children." (Source: Pew Research Center)
* **Key Stat 2:** "Family caregivers report spending an average of 24 hours per week providing care, with many citing technology management as a significant and growing source of stress." (Source: AARP "Caregiving in the U.S." Report)
* **Core Problem:** The burden of managing a parent's digital life is a major source of stress, consuming time and emotional energy.

### **Slide 3: The Fear: A Digital World Full of Risks**

* **Headline:** Protecting Our Parents from Online Threats is a Top Concern.
* **Key Finding:** "In 2021 alone, financial losses from online scams reported by victims over 60 totaled **$1.7 billion** in the US, a 74% increase from the previous year." (Source: FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center, 2021 Elder Fraud Report)
* **The Pain Point:** Families want their loved ones to be connected, but are terrified of them falling victim to phishing, scams, or malware. This fear often leads to avoiding technology altogether.

### **Slide 4: The Market: Families Are Already Investing in Solutions**

* **Headline:** The Senior Care Technology Market is a Multi-Billion Dollar Industry.
* **Key Stat:** "The global market for elder care technology is projected to grow from $12.7 billion in 2021 to **$32.6 billion by 2026**, demonstrating a massive and growing willingness to spend on tech-based solutions." (Source: MarketsandMarkets Research)
* **The Connection:** Families are willing to spend on technology that provides safety and peace of mind. However, most current solutions are reactive (fall detection) rather than proactive (connection, engagement).
* **The Opportunity:** Position Dodem as a proactive investment in a loved one's well-being, combining safety with the joy of connection.
* **Visual:** A comparison chart showing "Reactive" solutions (e.g., alert pendants) vs. Dodem's "Proactive" approach (engagement, secure communication, independence).

### **Slide 6: How We Prove Families Will Buy This**

* **Headline:** A Data-Driven Validation Plan
* **Step 1: Define the Buyer Persona:**
  * Use demographic data to quantify the "Sandwich Generation" market size in our target countries.
* **Step 2: Validate the Pain Point:**
  * Conduct a survey of 500 adults (aged 40-60) who manage technology for their parents. Measure stress levels, time spent, and willingness to pay for a solution.
* **Step 3: Test the Proposition & Price Point:**
  * Run a targeted Facebook/LinkedIn ad campaign with the "Peace of Mind" message. Direct traffic to a landing page detailing the features and benefits for caregivers. Offer a pre-order at a specific price point (e.g., "$X/month subscription") to gauge purchase intent.
* **Visual:** A simple flowchart graphic illustrating these three steps.
