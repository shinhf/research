*   **Headline:** Our Initial Target is the High-Value, English-Speaking Market.
*   **The Funnel (Step 1):**
    *   **Global Seniors:** ~1.4 Billion
    *   **Seniors in Core English-Speaking Countries (US, UK, CAN, AUS, NZ):** ~95 Million
*   **The Rationale:** This segment represents a large, economically developed market with a common language, allowing for a focused and efficient initial product launch and marketing strategy.

### **Slide 3: Identifying the True Customer (The Target Market)**

*   **Headline:** Our Customer Isn't Just Any Senior; They Are the Digitally Underserved.
*   **The Funnel (Step 2):**
    *   **Seniors in Core English-Speaking Countries:** ~95 Million
    *   **Digitally Underserved (Low Internet/Smartphone Adoption):** ~25 Million+
*   **The Core Insight:** We are targeting the significant portion of the market that has been left behind by the complexity of modern technology. This is not a niche; it's a multi-million person market with a clear and urgent need.
*   **Visual:** The funnel graphic continues, narrowing from 95 million to 25 million, with this segment labeled "Our Target Market."

### **Slide 4: Understanding the Buyer Personas (Market Segmentation)**

*   **Headline:** Three Key Groups Have the Motivation and Means to Buy Dodem.
*   **The Target Market is comprised of three distinct buyer segments:**
    1.  **The Seniors Themselves:** Seeking independence, connection, and empowerment. They are the end-users and a powerful consumer force.
    2.  **The Family (Adult Children):** Seeking peace of mind, security for their parents, and a reduction in their own caregiving stress. They are often the purchasers.
    3.  **The Institutions (U3As, Senior Centers):** Seeking to increase member engagement, future-proof their organizations, and scale their programs. They are the channel partners.
*   **Visual:** The base of the funnel splits into three distinct, equal streams, each labeled with one of the buyer personas.

### **Slide 5: Our Three-Pronged Strategy to Win the Market**

*   **Headline:** A Targeted Strategy for Each Buyer Persona.
*   **Our Go-to-Market plan is a direct response to this segmentation:**
    *   **To Win the Seniors:** We use **Strategy 1: The Empowerment & Independence Narrative.**
    *   **To Win the Families:** We use **Strategy 2: The "Peace of Mind" Proposition.**
    *   **To Win the Institutions:** We use **Strategy 3: The Institutional Partnership Model.**
*   **The Conclusion:** This is not a one-size-fits-all market. By understanding the distinct needs of each buyer and deploying a tailored strategy, we can effectively capture the entire target market.
*   **Visual:** The three streams from the previous slide flow into three boxes, each containing the title of the corresponding strategy.
