### Option 1: The "Problem Funnel" Approach

**Slide 1: The Big Picture: A Growing Senior Population**

*   **Headline:** A Large and Growing Digital Audience
*   **Key Statistic 1:** The global population of adults aged 65 and over is projected to reach **1.6 billion by 2050**.
*   **Key Statistic 2:** In the EU alone, over **20% of the population** is already over 65, a number that continues to rise.
*   **Core Message:** We are focusing on a massive, expanding, and increasingly important demographic.
*   **Visual Idea:** A simple, clean line graph showing the upward trend of the senior population over time (e.g., 2020 vs. 2050 projection).

### Option 2: The "Thematic Deep Dive" Approach

**Slide 1: The Senior's Experience: Life in a Digital World**

*   **Headline:** Connected, But Not Confident
*   **Key Statistic 1 (Device Adoption):** Seniors are already online.
    *   **91%** regularly use a mobile phone.
    *   **56%** of those over 65 use a tablet.
*   **Key Statistic 2 (The Skill Gap):** Despite high device ownership, only **28% of seniors in the EU** possess at least basic digital skills.
*   **Key Statistic 3 (Desire to Learn):** The motivation is there. **46%** would like help to improve their digital skills.
*   **Core Message:** The challenge isn't getting seniors to *own* technology; it's empowering them to *use it* effectively.
*   **Visual Idea:** A split-screen visual. On one side, an image of a senior happily using a tablet. On the other, a stark "28%" statistic highlighted in a contrasting color.

### Option 3: The "Myth vs. Reality" Approach

**Slide 1: Myth #1 - "Seniors are offline."**

*   **Headline:** Myth: Seniors are Disconnected from the Digital World.
*   **The Reality (in bold text):**
    *   **91%** of seniors regularly use a mobile phone.
    *   **56%** of those over 65 are tablet users.
*   **The Core Insight:** The problem isn't a lack of *access* to technology. It's a lack of *proficiency* and *confidence* with the devices they already own.
*   **Core Message:** We need to shift our thinking from "getting seniors online" to "making their online experience meaningful and independent."
*   **Visual Idea:** A simple, impactful design with a large, crossed-out icon of a flip phone or disconnected plug, replaced by a vibrant icon of a smartphone and tablet.
